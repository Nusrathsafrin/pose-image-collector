# Pose Image Collector

**Pose Image Collector** is a Python-based tool that fetches and organizes publicly available photo URLs from the [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/).  
It automatically categorizes photos into different pose types (e.g., standing, sitting, hands on hips, etc.) and stores metadata in an SQLite database for easy integration with apps that suggest poses based on context or location.
